"Disparity refers to the distance between two corresponding points in the left and right image of a stereo pair. Obviously this process involves choosing a point in the left hand frame and then finding its match (often called the corresponding point) in the right hand image; often this is a particularly difficult task to do without making a lot of mistakes. A useful topic to read about when performing stereo matching is rectification. This will make the process of matching pixels in the left and right image considerably faster as the search will be horizontal."
