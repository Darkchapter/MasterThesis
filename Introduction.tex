Since the early years of science fiction story telling in books and movies, the concept of enriching our environment with digital information and other virtual content fascinates humanity. Movie franchises like \textit{Star Trek} and \textit{Star Wars} introduced unbelievable technology to a broad audience. First and foremost stories of space travel via huge ships with the help of fantastic inventions are meant to be entertaining. Having said that, the writers try to put the sci-fi technology into the context of a possible future science to make the shows more believable and exciting. The \textit{Holodeck}\index{Holodeck} in Star Trek is a good example of such an attempt. The Holodeck is an  environment simulator, which creates virtual worlds with the help of holographic projections in special rooms. It is used by the crew of the Enterprise for entertainment but also for training purposes. Although we can not yet imagine how to create a holographic image with which we can interact in such a way, the idea of fully accessable virtual worlds, the \textit{virtual reality} (see \autoref{sec:VAR})\footnote{It could be arguable if the Holodeck is an VR or an AR environment. The projection creates virtual content and the users can fully interact with it. The Holodeck itself is just a blank room, which makes the people interacting in it the only \enquote{real components}. Therefore there is no virtual overlayed \enquote{real} environment but only the virtual world the users have access to. According to the definitions used in this thesis (\autoref{sec:VAR}), the Holodeck is more of a VR application.}, has been a heavily researched field since the mid 19th century (compare with \cite{Nasa.2009}, \cite[p.3]{Toennis.2010}, \cite[p.19 et seq.]{Doerner.2013} and \cite[p.4 et seq.]{Burdea.2003}).

\todo{spell-check from here}
However, in many ways the actual successful development of the required hardware and software is still in its early stages (see \autoref{sec:history} for a historical overview of this topic). And although we dreamed high, we \enquote{stayed 2D} for a long time, which led to disappointments and the people's rising loss of confidence in the technique.

But with the improvement of sensors, graphics computation and displays the development of AR and VR applications can finally make significant progress. While the entertainment industry seems to be the most anticipated and followed development by the public, the research on \textit{computer vision}\footnote{An explanation on this topic can be found at \autoref{ssec:cv}.} is mostly driven by the military, the NASA, the medical field and other technical industries in the background. The tracking, recognition, analyzing, and finally digitalization of real objects or persons are important research fields for the 3D computer vision. In the future surgeries should be fully supported with an AR overlay which displays the insides of the patient in real-time\footnote{The technology, with which the surgeons can see a real-time stereo vision with the help of tracking markers and stereoscopic glasses, is already far advanced (see \cite{Lowe.2016} for more examples).} and military drones should be able to distinguish between civilian and military buildings. Autonomous cars will reduce the risks on the streets and customers can design their individualized products interactively (see \autoref{fig:3dVisionary} for the vision NVIDIA presented in their promotional image for their new 3D technology).

Despite all the recent successes, researchers are still struggling to recover a 3D shape or analyzing and interpreting an image in its entirety. But why is it so difficult? Why are people still disappointed? The misperception can be dated back to the early stages of robotic and artificial intelligence, in which it was initially believed that computer vision would be the easiest part to realize (\cite[p.5]{Szeliski.2011}). 

Richard Szeliski, author of \textit{Computer Vision - Algorithms and Applications}, calls it an \enquote{inverse problem}: we try to find a solution on a basis of insufficient information provided by our non-perfect technologies. We need to resort to a physics- and mathematics-based concept to fill in these missing gaps and to create better \textit{models} of our real world. These include, for example, the modeling of shading and light reflection or the computation of the natural movement of colliding objects (compare with \cite[p.3 et seqq.]{Szeliski.2011}).  

In conclusion, the problems in computer vision can be broken down to mathematical algorithms in the end, which are still merely models and highly error prone. Some of these algorithms shall be topic of this thesis.

\section{About this thesis}
The present thesis is submitted in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in \textit{Computer Science in Media} of the faculty of \textit{Digital Media}. The high-speed cameras and their software components as well as technical support were provided by the company \textit{Optronis}.

--> fragestellung, aufgabenstellung, zu erreichender grad, wieso highspeed (lack of data --> come back to inverse problm), optronis --> on consumer level \\
--> the goal for consumer market is to make all easy and cheap 
--> the goal for industry is to connect virtual and real world content seamlessly  

- could use ideal images - already a lot of studies --> not real

\textit{Optronis}\index{Optronis} is a German company which is specialized in the field of ultra-fast optical measuring systems since 1986\footnote{Check Optronis' webpage for more detailed information about the company and its products: \url{http://www.optronis.com}}. Their products are used for research and science in several fields. Both their high-speed cameras for precision measurements and their streak camera technology, which makes photons visible, help monitoring and analyzing processes that are otherwise invisible for the human eye (\cite{Optronis.2016}).

This thesis is loosely linked to my bachelor's thesis, in which the \textit{Oculus Rift}, a head-mounted display\footnote{More information about head-mounted displays can be found in \autoref{sec:VAR}. The  bachelor's thesis is digitally attached (in German).}, was transformed into an AR device with the help of two webcams. The software was developed in \CS and the shading language \textit{Cg} in the \textit{Unity Engine} (\cite{Haefele.2014}).
