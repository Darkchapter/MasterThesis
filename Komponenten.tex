\subsection{MATLAB} \label{ssec:Matlab}
For the camera calibration as well as for the 3D reconstruction the commercial platform \textit{MATLAB}\index{MATLAB} by \textit{MathWorks} was used. MATLAB is a software that is specialized in solving mathematical problems (especially matrix operations) and visualizing data. The MATLAB programming language is matrix-based and implements object-oriented concepts like classes and inheritance. It comes with a huge library of in-built toolboxes for different engineering and scientific problems. Another strong point is its community, which provides scripts and discusses the newest problems (\cite{MathWorks.2016}).

A big part of the MATLAB community researches the algorithms of multiple view geometry in computer vision (see \autoref{c:relatedWorks} for examples) and the company MathWorks implements new content on this topic regularly. 

The reasons stated above led to the usage of MATLAB as the development environment of choice in this thesis. Initially MATLAB R2015b was used, but due to newly added functions for data refinement (see \autoref{sec:refinement}) the software needed to be updated to MATLAB R2016a.
   
The 3D reconstruction was programmed and organized in one MATLAB script file. To get the needed stereo parameters an in-built toolbox was used, which will be discussed in the following sections. A documentation about all used functions and a step-by-step-guide can be found in \autoref{c:Implementation}.

One of the biggest problems of MATLAB is its documentation. Although it often provides good examples and a lot of details, it is not explicit enough in some other important areas. Especially algorithms behind in-built functions are often times not explained making it difficult to find mistakes when the data output is unexpected\footnote{This \enquote{blackbox} problem with which you can not see how the output is created may be owed to the fact that MATLAB is (and is used as) a commercial software.}. The toolboxes often lack information as well, for example how the pipelines work, which coordinate system is used, etc. These problems restrict the programming quite a bit and force to either find a work around or use third party programs. More details on the encountered problems can be found in the following chapters (especially \autoref{sec:Calibration} and \todo{add all chapters with big probs here}).
