- really hard to classify
- describe aufgabenstellung in short here --> uncalibrated  static stereo cams as bases --> highspeed cams (a lot of pics) --> robotic --> algorithms used: stereo calibration --> BUT there is also structure from motion (which would need movement of cams --> problematic with these cams bc of lighting etc. 
- some of these present an idea for future works as well, more further readings in the closure chapter \autoref{sec:Future}
\begin{itemize}
\item groÃŸe family der computer vision applications: verweis auf background chapter --> todays usage (\autoref{ssec:Today})
\item many interesting projects worth to quote
\item facial reconstruction example from ramo et al
\item a lot of images: \cite{Okuma.2004} \url{http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/okuma04b.pdf}
\item often robotic --> object recognition, collider detection, wegfindung
